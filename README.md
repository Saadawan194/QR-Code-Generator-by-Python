# QR-Code-Generator-by-Python
I created a simple Python program that generates a QR code from a given URL. The user enters a website link, and the program converts it into a scannable QR code image. This makes sharing links quick and easy. The QR code can be saved and shared for websites, profiles, or online stores.
